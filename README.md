# Work-Day-Scheduler-App
An app that allows users to schedule their workday.

I created an app that allows users to schedule their workday and save the data to local storage to be retrieved later. The data storage takes today's date and saves data entered into a string value. 

Some key features include different colours for time-blocks that are in the past, present and future, and a message that appears and fades alerting the user that their data has been saved.

Some challenges included finding a way to create individual events for each button click, which I succeeded in though an area of development could be in ensuring the data only saves the array element that is pushed on click.
